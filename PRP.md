## Test Requirements (Infrastructure Validation)
### Unit Tests (100% coverage of infrastructure)
- Test pytest configuration loading
- Test fixture availability  
- Test parallel execution capability

### Integration Tests (100% coverage)
- Test coverage report generation
- Test CI/CD integration points
- Test agent coordination mechanisms

## Phase Gate - CANNOT PROCEED TO PRP 02a WITHOUT:
- [ ] 100% test coverage of infrastructure components
- [ ] All infrastructure tests passing
- [ ] pytest configuration validated
- [ ] Coverage reporting functional (HTML + XML)
- [ ] test-guardian approval for setup
- [ ] Edit locks cleared for parallel PRPs
- [ ] Agent collaboration documented

## Agent Execution Commands
```bash
# Launch parallel agents for this PRP
/run-agent test-automator --focus=infrastructure
/run-agent python-pro --task=pytest-setup  
/run-agent devops-infrastructure-agent --scope=testing
/run-agent test-guardian --mode=setup-validation
```

## Edit Lock Protocol
Files modified by this PRP:
- `pytest.ini` (test-automator lock)
- `conftest.py` (python-pro lock)
- `requirements-dev.txt` (devops-infrastructure-agent lock)
- `tests/` directory structure (test-automator lock)

## Success Validation
```bash
# Verify infrastructure is ready
pytest --collect-only  # Should discover test structure
coverage run --source=. -m pytest  # Should execute with coverage
coverage report --show-missing  # Should show 100% infrastructure coverage
```

## Next PRP Dependencies
This PRP enables:
- **PRP 02a**: Unit tests for core functions (needs test structure)
- **PRP 02b**: Unit tests for file operations (needs test fixtures)
- **PRP 03**: Integration tests (needs full infrastructure)

Duration: 4-6 hours
Parallel Execution: YES (with 01b, 01c)
Agent Count: 4 specialized agents
Coverage Requirement: 100% of test infrastructure components

# PRP 01b: Coverage Reporting Setup - pmake-recover

## ðŸš¨ WORKTREE REQUIREMENT
**All work MUST be done in the designated worktree:**
- **Worktree Path**: `/home/daniel/worktrees/pmake-recover/prp-01b-coverage-reporting`
- **Branch**: `prp-01b`
- **Agents MUST**: `cd /home/daniel/worktrees/pmake-recover/prp-01b-coverage-reporting` before any work

## CRITICAL: 100% TEST COVERAGE REQUIRED

**GUARDIAN AGENTS ENFORCING:**
- test-guardian will BLOCK progress without 100% coverage reporting
- test-guardian-enforced will validate report accuracy

## PARALLEL EXECUTION: Can run with PRPs 01a, 01c simultaneously

## Specialized Agents Required
- **test-guardian**: Primary enforcer of coverage requirements
- **devops-infrastructure-agent**: CI/CD reporting integration
- **test-automator**: Automated report generation
- **meta-agent**: Multi-format report coordination

## Deliverables (ONE ATOMIC FOCUS: Coverage Reporting)

### 1. Coverage Configuration
```ini
# .coveragerc
[run]
source = .
omit = 
    */tests/*
    */venv/*
    */__pycache__/*
    setup.py

[report]
exclude_lines =
    pragma: no cover
    def __repr__
    raise AssertionError
    raise NotImplementedError
    if __name__ == .__main__.:

[html]
directory = htmlcov

[xml]
output = coverage.xml
```

### 2. Multi-Format Report Generation
- **HTML Reports**: Visual coverage analysis
- **XML Reports**: CI/CD integration  
- **Console Reports**: Real-time feedback
- **JSON Reports**: Agent consumption

### 3. Coverage Thresholds (100% ENFORCED)
```python
# pytest.ini addition
addopts = 
    --cov=.
    --cov-report=html
    --cov-report=xml  
    --cov-report=term-missing
    --cov-fail-under=100
    --strict-markers
    --strict-config
```

### 4. Guardian Agent Integration
- test-guardian hooks for pre-commit
- test-guardian-enforced for CI/CD gates
- Automated coverage validation
- Block deployment without 100% coverage

## Test Requirements (Reporting System Validation)
### Unit Tests (100% coverage of reporting)
- Test HTML report generation
- Test XML report generation  
- Test console report accuracy
- Test threshold enforcement

### Integration Tests (100% coverage)
- Test guardian agent integration
- Test CI/CD pipeline integration
- Test multi-format report consistency
- Test coverage failure scenarios

## Guardian Enforcement Mechanisms
```bash
# Pre-commit hook (test-guardian)
#!/bin/bash
coverage run --source=. -m pytest
COVERAGE=$(coverage report | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/%//')
if [ "$COVERAGE" != "100" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Coverage is $COVERAGE%, must be 100%"
    exit 1
fi

# CI/CD gate (test-guardian-enforced)
coverage xml
python -c "
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
tree = ET.parse('coverage.xml')
coverage = float(tree.getroot().get('line-rate')) * 100
if coverage < 100:
    exit(1)
"
```

## Phase Gate - CANNOT PROCEED TO PRP 02a WITHOUT:
- [ ] 100% test coverage reporting functional
- [ ] All report formats generating correctly (HTML, XML, console, JSON)
- [ ] Coverage thresholds enforced at 100%
- [ ] test-guardian hooks installed and working
- [ ] test-guardian-enforced CI/CD gates active
- [ ] Report validation tests passing

## Agent Execution Commands
```bash
# Launch parallel agents for this PRP
/run-agent test-guardian --focus=reporting-setup
/run-agent devops-infrastructure-agent --task=ci-integration
/run-agent test-automator --scope=report-generation
/run-agent meta-agent --coordination=coverage-formats
```

## Edit Lock Protocol  
Files modified by this PRP:
- `.coveragerc` (test-guardian lock)
- `pytest.ini` (coordination with 01a via test-guardian lock)
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (devops-infrastructure-agent lock)
- CI/CD configuration files (devops-infrastructure-agent lock)

## Success Validation
```bash
# Verify reporting system works
coverage run --source=. -m pytest
coverage report  # Should show 100% requirement
coverage html    # Should generate htmlcov/
coverage xml     # Should generate coverage.xml
test -f coverage.json && echo "JSON report generated"

# Test guardian enforcement
pytest --cov=. --cov-fail-under=100  # Should pass/fail correctly
```

## Integration with Other PRPs
- **PRP 01a**: Coordinates pytest configuration updates
- **PRP 01c**: Shares security coverage requirements
- **PRP 02a/02b**: Provides coverage validation for unit tests
- **PRP 03**: Provides coverage validation for integration tests

Duration: 2-3 hours
Parallel Execution: YES (with 01a, 01c)  
Agent Count: 4 specialized agents
Coverage Requirement: 100% of reporting system components
