"""
Unit Tests for File Operations (PRP 02b)

This is a placeholder test file for the file operations functionality
that will be implemented in PRP 02b. These tests define the expected
behavior and API for secure file handling operations.

SECURITY FOCUS:
- Must enforce proper file permissions (600 for files, 700 for directories)
- Must validate file paths to prevent path traversal attacks
- Must handle file operations securely with proper error handling
- Must support atomic file operations where needed
- Must clean up sensitive data from memory after file operations
